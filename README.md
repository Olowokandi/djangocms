# djangocms
Django cms dockerfile and helm chart
Things i would have improved on if i had more time

1. Create health endpoint for the djangocms app
2. Proper Documentation for the helm charts
3. Properly enhanced the application to create a postgres database on k8 so application could still work without a database
4. Add more bash functions to take care of the enviromental variables been passed to the container
